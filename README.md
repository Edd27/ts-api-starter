# Node.js REST API template

This GitHub project template is designed to kickstart your Node.js REST API development.
It provides a set of essential files to help you maintain a clean and organized codebase for your Node.js REST API project.

## Features

1. **Directory structure:**
   - `/src`: This directory is where your Node.js application source code should be placed. It's organized into subdirectories, such as `/controllers`, `/dto`, `/routes`, `/services` and `/utils` to keep your code modular and maintainable.
     - `/config`: Configuration files, environment variables, and any other settings needed for your application.
     - `/test`: This directory is for your unit and integration tests using a testing framework.
2. **Package.json:**
   - Includes a well-defined package.json file that lists dependencies and scripts for common development and production tasks.
3. **ESLint and Prettier configuration:**
   - ESLint and Prettier are pre-configured to help maintain code quality and consistency.
4. **Git ignore:**
   - A `.gitignore` file is provided to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control.
